## Technologies used

This is a serverless, single-page app, featuring a contact form with file upload capabilities. I built the app in React, using React Router to simulate native URL features like back/forward and refresh. The submission forms are embedded in-page and powered by Hubspot. This eliminates the need for a dedicated server, and allows easy and free hosting on Github Pages. Instead of a dedicated database, all relevant data is stored in memory, in regular .js files.

- HTML, CSS
- React (+Hooks)
- React Router
- Hubspot Forms
- Github Pages
